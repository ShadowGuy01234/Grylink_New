GRYORK CONSULTANTS PVT LTD

Tagline / Value Proposition:

“Gryork unlocks capital for infrastructure receivables.”

Problem Statement (Page 3)
Core Problem

In India’s infrastructure sector:

Subcontractors face payment delays ranging from 5 months to 2 years, even after bill approval.

This disrupts:

Contractors

Subcontractors

Government / PSU clients

Key Insights

1. Delayed payments are the real issue

Not lack of projects.

2. Subcontractors face highest uncertainty

Clients pay contractors in 90–120 days

Contractors pay subcontractors in 120–180+ days

Result: Severe cash-flow stress

3. Working capital collapse slows execution

Contractors → Can raise finance

Subcontractors → Mostly cannot

Impact:

Delayed worker payments

Stalled execution

Missed timelines

4. Systemic economic impact

Chronic payment delays → Cost overruns + project delays

Estimated 1–2% GDP growth reduction annually

5. Existing solutions ignore majority

Current models serve balance-sheet-strong Pvt Ltd firms

Small contractors & proprietorships:

Blocked by collateral requirements

Receivables remain unusable
